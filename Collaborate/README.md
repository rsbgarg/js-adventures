Collaborate as the name suggests is a real time collaboration tool like CollabEdit, Google Docs.

Currently, Collaborate is a text only tool and contains a single edit page. 

The next step would be to add multi user - multi page functionality. 


Requirements:
Node 
npm


To run Collaborate locally, after cloning the repo. 
1. Run  'npm update' in the root folder so that the dependencies can be downloaded.
2.  In the root folder - 'node lib/index.js' and voila 

Collaborate will now be running on localhost:5000. 

Cheers.
